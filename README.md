## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this mobile application is to digitize the travel booking process for small to medium travel agencies and provide customers with an intuitive platform for discovering and booking travel packages. The app addresses the following problems:

- Difficulty in managing travel bookings manually
- Limited accessibility to travel package information for customers
- Inefficient communication between travel agencies and clients
- Lack of centralized customer data management

**Target Users:** Travel agency staff (admins/agents) and customers seeking to browse and book travel packages.

**Value Proposition:** The app streamlines the entire travel booking workflow, from package discovery to booking management, while providing agencies with tools to efficiently manage their inventory and customer relationships.

### 1.2 Scope

The Basic Travel Agency App is a cross-platform mobile application that enables users to browse travel destinations, view package details, make bookings, and manage their travel plans. Agency staff can manage packages, track bookings, and maintain customer information through an integrated admin panel.

**The system WILL:**
- Allow customers to browse travel packages and destinations with detailed information
- Enable booking creation, modification, and cancellation
- Store customer profiles, preferences, and booking history
- Provide an admin interface for package and booking management
- Support search and filtering capabilities for packages
- Track booking status and payment information
- Offer offline access to previously loaded booking details

**The system WILL NOT:**
- Include a web version in this phase
